# Migrating To Vitepress

While I want to keep this repo open as something I made, I have decided to make my life a little easier for future blogging by migrating my actual site to Vitepress and Decap CMS. While I still think it was a good experience creating this from scratch (well, with the help of some very good libraries, of course), I think it's just not practical to continue using this setup for a blog.

This is my personal site built with Rust and Actix Web serving static HTMX and AlpineJS modified HTML.
I also used the great project https://terminalcss.xyz/
